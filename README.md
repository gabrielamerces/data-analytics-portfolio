## About Me

I recently transitioned into data analytics from a career in project coordination. I hold a certificate in data analytics from Google and intermediate Python certification. I have a strong interest in using data to solve real business problems, and I enjoy working with both numbers and people.

I'm actively looking for junior-level data analyst or business intelligence roles in the UK (remote or hybrid).
